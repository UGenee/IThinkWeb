			<h2 class="section-heading">Why Study This Course?</h2>
			<p>
				If you're fascinated by the potential of machines to think, learn, and adapt, then studying Artificial
				Intelligence (AI) could be the perfect course for you. The field of computer science known as artificial
				intelligence, or AI, is focused on building intelligent machines that exhibit human-like behavior. The
				process of building smart machines, often referred to as intelligent machines, is intended to support
				the decision-making process, which is thoroughly examined utilizing data that is accessible within an
				organization. It functions similarly to how people do when combining information and coming to logical
				conclusions. In this case, though, a lot of data is reviewed before a judgment is reached.

			<h2 class="section-heading">Introduction to the Course</h2>
			<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) has transformed the way people think, learn, and work in various areas,
				including banking, healthcare, and smartphone applications. What’s more intriguing is that AI has a
				larger impact on our everyday lives than we realize. AI is all around us, from Siri and Ok Google to
				numerous virtual player games and social media applications. It is currently the most sought-after and
				thrilling career domain in the market. AI is a branch of computer science that emphasizes the creation
				of intelligent machines that behave like humans. The process of creating smart machines, also known as
				intelligent machines, assists in decision-making, which is analyzed in detail using available data
				within an enterprise. It works similarly to how humans synthesize data and make reasonable decisions but
				processes vast amounts of data in the case of AI.</p>
